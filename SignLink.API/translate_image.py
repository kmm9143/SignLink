# DESCRIPTION:  This script provides an API endpoint for ASL (American Sign Language) image classification.
#               It accepts an uploaded image, preprocesses it using MediaPipe to crop the hand region, and
#               then sends the cropped image to a Roboflow Inference API for ASL alphabet prediction.
#               The prediction result is returned as JSON for integration with frontend or other services.
# LANGUAGE:     PYTHON
